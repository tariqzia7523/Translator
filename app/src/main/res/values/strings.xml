<!--    <string name="temp_text">CHAPTERI          Down the Rabbit-Hole          Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or     twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, and what     is the use of a book thought Alice without pictures or conversation?          So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and     stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the     dalsies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.          There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the     Rabbit say to itself, Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be latel\' (when she thought it over afterwards, it Occurred to her that     she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK     A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT- POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it     flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take     Out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pOp     down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge          In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.          The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that     Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.          Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look     about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was     coming to, but it was too darkto see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were     filled with cupboards and book-shelves, here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took     down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \'ORANGE MARMALADE, but to her great     disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into     one of the cupboards as she fell past it.          Welll\' thought Alice to herself, \'after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How     brave they\'ll all think me at homel Why, I wouldnt say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the housel\' (Which     was very likely true,)          Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! T wonder how many miles Ive fallen by this time?     she said aloud. T must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four     thousand miles down, I think&#45;&#45;\" (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the     schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no     one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)-yes, that\'s about the right distance&#45;&#45;but then I wonder     what Latitude or Longitude Ive got to?\' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they     were nice grand words to say)          Presently she began again. Twonder if l shall fall right THROUGH the earthl How funny itll seem to come out     among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think-(she was rather glad there WAS     no one listening, this time, as it didnt sOund at all the righvord)butI shall have to ask them what the name of     the country is, you know. Please, Ma\'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke     -fancy CURTSEYING as you\'re falling through the airl Do you think you could manage it?) \'And what an ignorant     litle girl she\'ll think me for asking! No, itll never do to ask perhapsI shall see it written up somewhere.</string>-->
